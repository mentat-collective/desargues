  "Reversible Manim patches behind desargues.manim.patch-protocols/IManimPatch.

   svg-path-shared-copy: Mobject.copy is a full copy.deepcopy, and every
   VMobjectFromSVGPath (one per glyph of a Text / MathTex) carries the parsed
   svgelements Path it was built from. That Path is read only while the points
   are generated at construction, yet deepcopy clones it on every copy (FadeIn
   copies the whole group twice per play). The patch gives VMobjectFromSVGPath
   a __deepcopy__ that shares the Path between original and copy and copies
   the rest as Manim does, so the copies' points, colours and frames are the
   same."
